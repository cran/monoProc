To Do List for the package monoProc:
add further monoproc-Methods to the package for other regression estimation classes
extend the cross validation function cv to the other monoproc-classes
extend to higher-dimensions 
the monoproc method for loess classes is currently only implemented if the formula has only one independent variable - should be changed
write the function mono.1d and mono.2d (the basic functions of this package) in C to make monoproc faster
